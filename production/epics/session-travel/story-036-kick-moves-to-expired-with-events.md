## Context

**GDD**: `design/gdd/session-travel.md`
**Requirement**: `TR-session-001`
*(Requirement text lives in `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml` — read fresh at review time. At write time: TR-session-001 = Listen-server direct join; ordered admission gates at PreLogin; capacity 2 x TeamSize)*

**ADR Governing Implementation**: ADR-0005: Session, seamless travel and match-scoped state stores
**ADR Decision Summary**: AGameModeBase with no match-state machine; four game-instance stores (Session, Roster, Round, Tuning preset) are the only authoritative match state; engine seamless ServerTravel with ?Seed=/?Preset=/?Round= server options and a re-bind of the replaced PlayerController and PlayerState on arrival; Session's single server-requested round acknowledgement; admission gates in PreLogin; Session's own clamped silence clock with engine timeouts as a backstop; rejoin and supersede that re-attach the retained PlayerState; default login pawn disabled; no host migration.
**ADR Version**: 2026-10-24

**Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.8 (installed 5.8.4) | **Risk**: HIGH
**Engine Notes**: Uses only long-standing AGameModeBase, APlayerController and UNetDriver hooks, each re-read in the 5.8.4 source, so residual risk is behavioural (spikes S3, S4, S5), not API names. Seamless travel is disabled in single-process PIE unless net.AllowPIESeamlessTravel=1 (E7), so every travel acceptance test runs multi-process standalone. DispatchPostLogin is deprecated since 5.6: override PostLogin/OnPostLogin. The listen host never passes PreLogin (E2). Use UE_LOGF for logging.

**Why this story**: This story delivers `kick-moves-to-expired-with-events` as one buildable behaviour: a host kick expires the participant at once with Disconnected(Kicked) then RejoinWindowExpired. It is traced to the GDD criterion below and to TR-session-001. Read these GDD sections before starting (use `bash .claude/scripts/md-section.sh extract design/gdd/session-travel.md "<heading>"` or Grep `^#` then Read a range; the GDD is 150 KB, never read it whole): States and Transitions; Core Rules rule 7. Where this story overlaps a neighbour, the Out of Scope list says which story owns the other half.

**Control Manifest Rules (Foundation layer, manifest 2026-10-25e)**:
- Required: AStealthGameMode derives AGameModeBase; authoritative match state lives only in the four game-instance stores, keyed by ParticipantId, never by controller or PlayerState pointer; every Session RPC is owner-only and the participant is derived from the receiving connection; every wait is bounded by a server-measured clock; HandleStartingNewPlayer is a no-op (ADR-0005)
- Forbidden: AGameMode, AddInactivePlayer/FindInactivePlayer or address-keyed reclaim; anything authoritative on a PlayerController, PlayerState, GameMode or GameState; a secret in a travel URL or login option, or client code parsing travel URL options; a multicast Session RPC; a client message that starts, extends or restarts a deadline; Session spawning, freeing, hiding or possessing a pawn or calling RequestTransition; overriding DispatchPostLogin (ADR-0005)
- Guardrail: Session silence clocks and ack bookkeeping inside the 0.5 ms line; travel load bounded by TravelLoadTimeoutSec (60 s) (ADR-0005)

## Acceptance Criteria

*From GDD `design/gdd/session-travel.md` Acceptance Criteria no. 59, scoped to this story (one criterion, `story_granularity: fine`):*

- [ ] **Kick**: GIVEN an Active participant, WHEN the host kicks them, THEN the disconnect reason is `Kicked`, the participant is `Expired` with no window in the same tick (the transition-table kick row), `OnParticipantDisconnected(Kicked)` precedes `OnRejoinWindowExpired`, the Roster notify carries `bKicked = true` and no `ConnectionGeneration` bump from the move into `Expired`, and a later attempt with that key is rejected `Refused` even while admission is `Closed`. `KickedSlotReleased` [U]

---

## Implementation Notes

*Derived from ADR-0005 Implementation Guidelines and the GDD rules named above:*

- State table kick row: any live state to Expired in-round with no window; OnParticipantDisconnected(Kicked) precedes OnRejoinWindowExpired in the same tick; the Roster notify carries bKicked = true and the move into Expired does not bump ConnectionGeneration, so Round's later grace-expiry Disconnect is accepted (Roster R11 kick path; ADR-0005 section 5).

**Prototype disposition** (`production/first-playable-report.md`, `Source/StealthGame`): None: the prototype has no session handling, identity key, admission, liveness or travel, so there is nothing to replace or promote.

**Tuning values**: read every threshold, timeout and default from the `Session` knob sub-struct in tuning (session-latched, ADR-0004); never hardcode a gameplay value.

## Out of Scope

*Handled by neighbouring stories — do not implement here:*

- Story 035 (`story-035-kicked-key-refused.md`): refusal of the kicked key

## Files

*The code and test files this story creates or changes. `/create-stories` lists the planned ones; `/dev-story` replaces the list with the files it changed; `/story-done` checks scope against it.*

- `Source/StealthFoundation/Public/Server/Session/StealthSessionCore.h`
- `Source/StealthFoundation/Private/Session/StealthSessionCore.cpp`
- `Source/StealthFoundation/Private/Tests/Session/KickedSlotReleasedTest.cpp`
- Module placement follows ADR-0007 section 2 (`Public/Server/` for server-only headers with the guard include first, `Public/View/` for client-safe ones); confirm before creating a header.

## QA Test Cases

*Written by qa-lead (QL-STORY-READY: ADEQUATE). Implement against these; do not invent new test cases during implementation.*

**Automated test spec:**

- **AC-1**: **Kick**: GIVEN an Active participant, WHEN the host kicks them, THEN the disconnect reason is `Kicked`, the participant is `Expired` with no window in the same tick (the transition-table kick row), `OnParticipantDisconnected(Kicked)` precedes `OnRejoinWindowExpired`, the Roster notify carries `bKicked = true` and no `ConnectionGeneration` bump from the move into `Expired`, and a later attempt with that key is rejected `Refused` even while admission is `Closed`. `KickedSlotReleased` [U]
  - Given: An Active participant.
  - When: The host kicks them.
  - Then: The disconnect reason is Kicked. The participant is Expired with no window in the same tick. OnParticipantDisconnected(Kicked) precedes OnRejoinWindowExpired. The Roster notify carries bKicked = true and there is no ConnectionGeneration bump from the move into Expired. A later attempt with that key is rejected Refused even while admission is Closed.
  - Edge cases: none beyond the criterion

## Test Evidence

*Governed by `qa.level: full`: tests are required evidence for Logic and Integration; a Visual/Feel or UI story's retained screenshot is required at every `qa.level`.*

**Story Type**: Logic
**Required evidence**:
- Logic: `Source/StealthFoundation/Private/Tests/Session/KickedSlotReleasedTest.cpp` — automation test `StealthGame.Session.KickedSlotReleased` must exist and pass (`/story-done` checks it exists; pass/fail is established by `/gate-check` and `/smoke-check`)

**Status**: [ ] Not yet created

Test naming follows `.claude/rules/test-standards.md` and ADR-0008: automation name `StealthGame.Session.KickedSlotReleased`, T1 unit test, class `FSessionKickedSlotReleasedTest` (one class per `IMPLEMENT_SIMPLE_AUTOMATION_TEST`), flags `EAutomationTestFlags::EditorContext | EAutomationTestFlags::ProductFilter`; wrap the file in `#if WITH_DEV_AUTOMATION_TESTS`; tests use an injected clock and entropy, no wall-clock time as a pass predicate, no shared mutable state, and assert zero unexpected faults at teardown.

## Dependencies

- Depends on: `production/epics/session-travel/story-015-connection-state-machine-illegal-transitions.md`, `production/epics/session-travel/story-035-kicked-key-refused.md`
- Cross-epic: Epic `tuning-data-config` (`production/epics/tuning-data-config/EPIC.md`): the ADR-0007 module skeleton (StealthFoundation, StealthGameplay, StealthPresentation, StealthTestHarness), test harness and CI must exist before the files below can be created at those paths. Until it lands, write the code and tests under `Source/StealthGame/` (Private/Tests/) and move them when the skeleton arrives.
- Cross-epic: Epic `participant-state-roster` (`production/epics/participant-state-roster/EPIC.md`): the registration API (RegisterParticipant, RebindView, NotifyConnectionChanged, IsRoundScopeReset, InvalidateAllBindings) is a peer epic built in the same window; use a fake Roster behind the interface for Logic tests.
- Cross-epic: Epic `round-match-framework` (`production/epics/round-match-framework/EPIC.md`) consumes Session's events and pushes the admission mode; use a fake Round behind the consumer-owned interfaces here.
- Unlocks: None
